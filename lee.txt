is there anything similar to this project in the pipleine for jlr?

nothing as extreme as just voice control, they have other attention control methods. also working on reducing the amount of demand created by the systems in the cars
they already use voice a bit, providing voice controls at an "appropriate level", also "proactive voice commands", they get to the point that the car nudges them towards using voice instead of speech
android auto tells you after you do something that you can use voice commands, apple carplay just guides you through doing things with voice
the challenge to think about is "how can you get the balance of the voice system and the screen?", as you can't do everything through voice
people will also tend to look at things as they talk to them - point of consideration with screen dimming / disabling
(update: john says that this isn't really a concern since that is all integrated into the modern cars' heads up display)
jlr have the satnav which says "you can use the keyboard but we'd really like for you to use voice"
"turning everything to voice" isnt something they have actively looked at
"how can we move people over to making voice a more appropriate choice than physical input" is a big question they've been considering 
not everyone wants to use voice, some voices wont work depending on accents
if you start a task in one mode it wont change until the next task, i.e. if you start the satnav with voice you can't switch to touch halfway through

how viable is this project?
most car companies are looking into it, but again it is all about switching contexts / people's preferences, exploring the idea and thinking about how you design it is still worth looking into
